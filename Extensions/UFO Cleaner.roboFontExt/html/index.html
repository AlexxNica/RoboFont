		<h1>UFO Cleaner</h1>
		<p>UFO Cleaner displays a list of items that are stored in the library of the current UFO. Items can then be marked for deletion, or double-clicked to display their contents.</p>
		<p>This is to reduce the UFO file size, and to protect your privacy by wiping out internal production data.</p>
		
		<h2>Interface</h2>
		<p><img src="ufo-cleaner-main.png" width="500" height="289" alt=""></p>
		<p>The main view displays a list of all library items. Items are identified by their key, which is displayed in the fourth column.</p>
		<p>Marking a check box in the first column means that this item will be deleted from the UFO library when you press the delete button.</p>
		
		<p>Double-clicking a row brings up a sheet which shows the contents of the selected library item.</p>

		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<p>RoboFont layers are also stored in the UFO library, and take up considerable space there, but they can’t be accessed from within RoboFont via the library.</p>
